  <p style="margin:0 0 0.75rem 0;">With water being the most abundant liquid on Earth's surface, ice nucleation is a critical process that continually changes the environment that we live and experience.
It dictates the outcome of life itself, from the inhibition of ice nucleation through antifreeze proteins in cryophilic life combating sub-zero conditions, to the formation of snow in a treacherous blizzard.
Beyond natural scenarios for ice nucleation, there are also anthropogenic causes.
An example acutely tangible to us can be observed when a jet aircraft flies overhead: contrails.

  <p style="margin:0 0 0.5rem 0;">With experimental EDS data as an input, I performed simulated annealing with a developed Machine Learning Interatomic Potential 
to generate experimentally characteristic atomistic structures of soot.
Then, performing enhanced sampling, I could accelerate ice nucleation to classify specific surface sites that drive nucleation.
With this, the nucleating ability of soot could be quantified.</p>
