  <p style="margin:0 0 0.75rem 0;">Efficient proton transport is essential for advancing solid-state fuel cells and electrolyzers, yet the mechanisms 
governing proton diffusion in polycrystalline barium zirconate (BaZrO<sub>3</sub>) remain incompletely understood.
Experimental and theoretical studies often report discrepancies in the activation energy of proton diffusion, primarily 
due to limitations in modeling complex microstructures, such as grain boundaries and defects, at relevant time and length scales.
With the high dimensionality of grain boundaries, new models are required to accurately capture the microstructure of 
polycrystalline barium zirconate.

  <p style="margin:0 0 0.5rem 0;">I simulated a barium zirconate powder under high pressure and temperature to simulate pellet formation via hot press.
The pseudo-pellet is then considered for its microstructure and proton transport properties.
With this consideration, we can better describe the proton transport properties of polycrystalline barium zirconate.
