<p>Machine learning has seen a wide application across many different fields, from medicine, biology, physics, and chemistry.
It is both a powerful (and sometimes dangerous) tool; many questions within the field of chemical science have been answered using machine learning methods.
In my research, I use these methods when considerable insight can be given.
This has varied from using neural network potentials, kernel methods for classification, and generative models for material prediction.</p>
<p>I will continue to apply these methods in my research when both beneficial and suitable; care must be taken that machine learning based predictions can be verified.</p>
