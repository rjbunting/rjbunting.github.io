<p>The modelling of surface chemistry with <em>ab initio</em> techniques has remained largely unchanged since its conception as a field.
Models are limited to cluster or slab models, where surfaces are engineered to consider defects or different stepped surfaces.
These models are far from the physical systems, where several macro-scale processes take place, such as grain boundary formation, Ostwald ripening, sintering, and surface evolution.
My previous research considers some of these effects, namely surface redox processes and the formation of active surface sites under finite temperature conditions.
These effects have a huge affect on the reactivity and selectivity of systems, stressing the importance of modelling them.</p>
<p>I hope to further my research in this area, considering catalyst systems on a micro and macro scale together to drive the gap between calculated and experimental results.</p>
