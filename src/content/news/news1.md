<p>A new ECTS credited course will begin at IST Austria in Fall 2 for the 2023 academic year.
It is titled "An Introduction to Computational Chemistry" and I am the coordinator.</p>

<p>Computational methods are used throughout all fields of chemistry.
From organic, inorganic, physical, and bio chemistry, a plethora of methods are used to explain experimental results and sometimes even to make discoveries preceding experimental verification.
This course will provide a strong foundation for experimentalists and theoreticians to understand the possibilities and limitations for the most widely used methods in chemistry and condensed matter physics.</p>

<p>This course will consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why computers</li>
<li>Empirical methods</li>
<li>Semi-empirical methods</li>
<li>Quantum chemical methods</li>
<li>Density Functional theory</li>
<li>Machine learning methods</li>
<li>Molecular modelling</li>
<li>Kinetics and chemical Reactions</li>
<li>Periodic systems -Surface Chemistry</li>
<li>Molecular dynamics</li>
<li>Biochemical systems</li>
</ul>

<p>Students will combine all of their acquired knowledge to complete a small project, combining aspects of the entire course together to describe a chemical system.</p>
